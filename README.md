# Markov Chain Monte Carlo
Gibbs and Metropolis-Hastings are investigated with Python examples.

In summary: There are several MCMC algorithms including Gibbs and Metropolis-Hastings. A MCMC algorithm is a procedural approach to establish parameters of a logistic regression if you have access to the conditional probabilities.  A MCMC algorithm uses random sampling (Monte-Carlo) using the last sample (Markov Chain) as evidence.  There is an assumption the conditional probabilities are of normal distribution.
